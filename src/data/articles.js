programme in the N.I.T Tiruchirapalli campus with an average intake of 70 students per year.
The Computer Science and Engineering Department spares no effort in imparting High Quality 
Education to its highly Motivated students. The B.E. programme innovatively designed to 
cater to the Global demands offers a balanced coverage of hardware, software with emphasis 
on various aspects of Software including programming.
The programme includes elective courses covering thrust areas such as Distributed Computing, 
Parallel Architecture, High-Speed Networks and Multimedia Systems. The programme is 
supported by the infrastructure facilities available in the Octagon, this centre is 
connected to the Internet via 2Mbps leased line from Software Technology Park of India 
(STPi).
The B.Tech. programme enjoys an enviable placement of almost 100% year after year. About 15%
of the students pursue higher studies, mostly in the U.S with scholarship and even with 
fellowship. The Computers Today included the department among the 12 best schools in 
Computer Science, for the B.Tech. Programme in India.

The Electronics and Communication Engineering department has been offering an undergraduate 
course since 1968. In 1976 the course was diversified with emphasis on Solid-State 
Electronics, Digital and Switching Circuits, Information Theory, Space Communication, and 
other relevant subjects. This program was granted autonomy from the academic year 1986-1987.
The focus of the B.Tech Degree Program is on Mobile Communications. The curriculum is so 
designed as to give adequate emphasis on the digital processing of information for efficient
communication over noisy channels. In tune with the above objective, the program includes 
courses like Statistical Theory of Communication, Microwave and Optical Communication, 
Computer Networks, DSP architecture and Systems, Communication Electronics Circuits, 
Photonic Devices and Systems, Design of Cognitive Radio, Data Structures and Algorithms, 
giving a balanced coverage of Theory and Practical Modern Communication Engineering, 
Embedded Systems, VLSI Systems, Internet of Things, Pattern Recognition, Deep Learning, 
Introduction to Machine Learning & Design of ASICs.
The core program is supplemented and further reinforced by a well-chosen set of elective 
courses permitting the students to specialize either in the software or the hardware aspect 
of communication systems. The curriculum also includes courses on Industrial Economics and 
Foreign Trades.    `
